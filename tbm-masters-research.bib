	Abstract = {Questions from Stack Overflow provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into what programming concepts are the most confusing. We present a topic modeling analysis that combines question concepts, types, and code. Using topic modeling, we are able to associate programming concepts and identifiers (like the String class) with particular types of questions, such as, ``how to perform encoding''.},
	Annote = {This paper analyzed questions using the topic and tags for the most part. The paper discusses the results of their analysis, with very little focus on their methods used. They did, however, use an interesting method of parsing and tagging the questions, using adverb-verb type sequences to decide on the ``type'' of question. 

The focus was on results of analysis, and what it meant for coding topics and discussions. For example, it emphasized the most commonly asked question types across each language, shedding some light on what types of things give programmers the most trouble.},

	Abstract = {The Internet is frequently used as a medium for exchange of information and opinions, as well as propaganda
dissemination. In this study the use of sentiment analysis methodologies is proposed for classification of web
forum opinions in multiple languages. The utility of stylistic and syntactic features is evaluated for sentiment
classification of English and Arabic content. Specific feature extraction components are integrated to account
for the linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The Entropy Weighted Genetic Algorithm (EWGA) is also
developed, which is a hybridized genetic algorithm that incorporates the information gain heuristic for feature
selection. EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of the key features. The
proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review data set and U.S. and Middle
Eastern web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance
levels, with accuracy over 95% on the benchmark data set and over 93% for both the U.S. and Middle Eastern
forums. Stylistic features significantly enhanced performance across all test beds while EWGA also
outperformed other feature selection methods, indicating the utility of these features and techniques for
document level classification of sentiments.},

``We propose the following research questions:
1) Can sentiment analysis be applied to web forums in multiple languages?
2) Can stylistic features provide further sentiment insight and classification power?
3) How can feature selection improve classification accuracy and identify key
sentiment attributes?'' (p. 10-11)

	Abstract = {In addition to information, text contains
attitudinal, and more specifically,
emotional content. This paper explores
the text-based emotion prediction problem
empirically, using supervised machine
learning with the SNoW learning architecture.
The goal is to classify the emotional
affinity of sentences in the narrative
domain of children's fairy tales, for
subsequent usage in appropriate expressive
rendering of text-to-speech synthesis.
Initial experiments on a preliminary
data set of 22 fairy tales show encouraging
results over a na¨ıve baseline and BOW
approach for classification of emotional
versus non-emotional contents, with some
dependency on parameter tuning. We
also discuss results for a tripartite model
which covers emotional valence, as well
as feature set alternations. In addition, we
present plans for a more cognitively sound
sequential model, taking into consideration
a larger set of basic emotions},
	Annote = {Notes from pages (2-3) of notebook 1:

This was an interesting paper that used emotion annotators (volunteers) to create a dataset of sentences from children's fairytales to be used in a k-fold cross-validation using the SNoW architecture. Their dataset was too small and had too much human classification disagreement within sentences, so their results were not very conclusive. More annotators and a wider source material (perhaps tales off the internet) may bring more information to this topic.},
