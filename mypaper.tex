\section{Introduction}
\section{Background}
The average programmer today is familiar with Stack Overflow, a forum
designed for asking and answering programming related questions. Stack
Overflow is open to anyone whether they be professional or a hobbyist or
just starting out. Due to its open nature, posts on Stack Overflow cover
a large variety of questions over a number of languages. A quick internet
search for a programming issue is likely to result in a Stack Overflow post
as a top result.

Thanks to the ubiquitous nature of Stack Overflow, analysis on the site
offers a way to obtain a large amount of information on programmers'
practices and problems. One prior analysis of Stack Overflow utilized an 
alternate method of parsing and tagging of data, using an adverb-verb 
formulation instead of the traditional noun and verb word bagging. This 
method of analysis was performed on the topics of Stack Overflow posts and 
allowed the researchers to evaluate the types of questions seen 
corresponding to different programming languages and different Stack 
Overflow tags. This analysis shed light on what types of questions are more 
common between different languages; additionally, this study helped to 
reveal some of the most common uses of each langauge \cite{allamanis2013and}.
